These regions are removed from countries-to-generate.json, because ther are too large even for extra_small profile:
```
257829111 Aug  3 15:55 'Russia_Sakha Republic.isolines'
164222539 Aug  3 15:45 'Russia_Krasnoyarsk Krai_North.isolines'
143032904 Aug  3 15:36  US_Alaska.isolines
```
Other USA and Russia regions are promoted: poor -> extra_small. "poor" profile is completely useless, IMO.
